# **mAb_optimal_allocation**

## This folder contains all the codes and data used to generate figures in the manuscript and the supplement titled  _Prophylaxis vs therapeutic: optimal allocation of monoclonal antibodies for SARS-CoV-2_. 

### Please follow these steps to run the codes:

- Open the R project: mab_allocation.Rproj
- All the calculations are done within the functions in the folder named _R_. They contain the dose-response relationship with prohylaxis and therapeutic. Unless you need to change the codes within the functions, there is no need to pay specific attention to this folder.
- First, run the file named _packages_and_load_func.R_ to load the required packages and the functions in the R folder. 
- The files relevant to generating each figure are named after them. Please run the desired file to generate the required figure.
